I am thrilled to announce that I have successfully completed all three internship tasks at CodSoft. These tasks provided me with valuable hands-on experience in different areas of data science.



Task 1 - Credit Card Fraud Detection:



Developed a model to accurately detect fraudulent transactions, ensuring secure and reliable financial transactions.



Task 2: Iris Classification using Machine Learning



For this task, I applied machine learning algorithms to classify different species of iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. I explored various classification techniques and evaluated their performance. The final model exhibited excellent accuracy in predicting the correct species of iris flowers.



Task 3: Titanic Survival Prediction



In the third task, I developed a predictive model to forecast the survival of passengers on the Titanic. I analyzed historical data on passengers' characteristics, such as age, gender, and class, to identify factors influencing survival. The model achieved a high predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights into the factors that contributed to passenger survival.
